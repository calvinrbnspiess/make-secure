# Make Secure

This project is aimed to provide a simple wizard to secure a web server with TLS/SSL. The project is written in Deno and can be consumed as pre-complied binaries.
Make sure to execute the binaries matching your platform and processor architecture.

## Testing

The project is tested against a docker compose environment running apache2. The server will spin up without tls/ssl configuration and serve a basic web page available on http://127.0.0.1:8282. The server can be configured to use the provided certificate pair.

Generating a sample certificate pair can be done with the following command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout demo-crt/key.pem -out demo-crt/cert.pem  -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/C=DE/ST=Rhineland-Palatinate/L=SampleCity/O=SampleOrganization/CN=localhost" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,DNS:*.localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"
```

We need to make sure [Subject Alternative Names](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66839523/13353068) are given. Despite that, browsers won't trust the certificate, because it was not issued by a trusted CA.

Thankfully, there is a simple way to make the browser trust self-signed certificates. The tool [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) generates certificates signed by a locally trusted CA. Using this tool the browser won't show any warnings.

The following command will generate a certificate pair using mkcert for localhost:

```bash
mkcert -install # to make sure the locally trusted CA is installed
mkcert -key-file tests/demo-crt/key.pem -cert-file tests/demo-crt/cert.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1 # generate a certificate pair for localhost
```

### About X.509 - Common file types

![Application to X.509 Certificate](https://i.sstatic.net/Ku0lg.png)

```plaintext
- .der -> binary encoded
- .pem -> base64 encoded
- .crt -> could be DER or PEM, means it is the public key (difference might not be clear by just checking file extension)
- .key / key.pem -> private key
```

# Running the cli

The interactive wizard can be started by running the following command:

```bash
make-secure
```

The script will guide you through the process of securing your web server. The following steps are executed:

- It will be verified the binary is executed in a linux environment with installed [apt package manager](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/apt.8.html).
- The script will install testssl.sh as an automated test tool for the TLS/SSL configuration.
- You will be prompted to provide a publicly reachable domain name in order to check the webserver.
- A quick connection check on http/https will be performed. If the server is not reachable over https, this will be fixed later. If the server is not reachable over http, you probably have a configuration issue.
- Now, testssl.sh will run against the server. A brief summary about some key measures will be shown.
- You will be asked to provide the path to the certificate and key file. For my tests, I used the certificate pair generated by mkcert. Both files were in `.pem` format.
- You will be prompted which web server you are using. - Currently, only Apache is supported ðŸ˜¥ Feel free, to create a [PR](https://github.com/calvinrbnspiess/make-secure/pulls).
- The webserver configuration will be updated automatically. The server will be restarted.
- A connection check will be performed again. If the server is reachable over https, everything is fine. If not, something went horribly wrong.
- The script will run `testssl.sh` again to verify the configuration.

ðŸŽ‰ Yiiihaaa! Your server is now secured with TLS/SSL. ðŸŽ‰

# Building binaries

```bash
deno run build
```

Binaries are stored in the `bin` directory. Go to: https://github.com/calvinrbnspiess/make-secure/tree/main/bin

# Running the tests

Make sure to have a deno runtime installed. You can look at the [official documentation](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) for more information.

Alternatively, you can run deno in a docker container: `docker-compose -f deno.docker-compose.yaml up -d` and `docker exec -it make-secure-dev-environment /bin/bash`. In the container you can now run deno with `deno run dev`.

To run a build and run the make-secure script, execute the following commands:

```bash
deno run build
docker compose -f tests/docker-compose.yaml down
docker compose -f tests/docker-compose.yaml up -d
docker exec tls-configurator-apache rm -rf /tmp/make-secure
docker exec tls-configurator-apache mkdir -p /tmp/make-secure
docker cp bin tls-configurator-apache:/tmp/make-secure
````
(this is the same as executing the `deployToDocker.sh` script)

You can enter the container using `docker exec -it tls-configurator-apache /bin/bash`.

Now you can run the compiled binary:

```bash
/tmp/make-secure/bin/linux/arm64/make-secure (on arm64 platform)
```

The certificate files inside `tests/demo-crt/` are mounted inside the container at `/usr/local/apache2/certificates/`.

When asked for the certificate path, provide `/usr/local/apache2/certificates/cert.pem`.
When asked for the key path, provide `/usr/local/apache2/certificates/key.pem`.

## Verification

The page should be reachable over HTTP at [http://localhost:8282](http://localhost:8282). Before running the tests, the server should not be reachable over HTTPS.

![Unsecure page](assets/testpage-unsecure.png)

After running the wizard succesfully, the server should be reachable over HTTPS. Due to the local environment, the page is not reachable over default port `:80` and `:443`.

Thus, you can check the page at [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443). The certificate should be trusted by the browser and the page should display a closed lock illustration.

The page should look like this:
